<h1>Let’s start with the basics!</h1>
<h4>
<p>
What is information security? What about cyber security? When can we say we are secure? 
</p>
Well in case no one can access your data then we can say we are secure, well not so easy have you ever try to access an email address when you cannot remember the password? It is frustrating, and it is worst when you don’t remember even the right answers of the security questions? What now the only way is to use a recovery email … ups no recovery email … what do we do now? No associated phone number to recover the password, it is crazy, and then you remember... your friend told you it will be secure in case you change it often and you did it! 
<p>
In one way the mailbox is secure, but you cannot access it… Lets go back what is information security, it is to secure your data but it is even to access it and of course even to be able to modify it remember after forgetting your password the only way to access your mailbox is to change it. </p>
<p>This bring us to the 3 principles of information security:<B> availability, confidentiality, </B>and <B>integrity </B>. <BR>The first is clear you must have always the possibility to access your data (in this sample being able to access the mailbox), the second is confidentiality, this principle mean, only the authorized person (in security we use the term owner of the information) or who he/she want can access the information and least one integrity, in our example integrity can be refer as the data you have in your mailbox is left unmodified or changed. In case you think about, it is easy to consider the information we own secure when we secure these 3 principles.<BR>
Referring to us-cert.org cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. So, it is the same as protecting our mail information, but now we must take in consideration even the ways information is stored, processed, and moved (data at rest, in motion and data in use).
